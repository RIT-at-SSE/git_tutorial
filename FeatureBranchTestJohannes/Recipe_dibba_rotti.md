## Soaking Lentils And Rice Rava
1. Rinse urad dal a couple of times in water. 
2. Drain all the water and then soak urad dal in a bowl with 1 cup water for 3 to 4 hours. 
3. Take rice rava or idli rava in a large bowl. We will first rinse the rava. 
4. Add water till it floats a few centimetres on top of the rava layer. Gently mix the rava with water. Let this mixture rest for some seconds. Gently discard the water from the top. Do this method once or twice. 
5. Then add 1.5 cups water for soaking rice Rava for 3 to 4 hours.
6. Note: if you do not have rice rava, then soak ¾ cup rice in water for 3 to 4 hours. Drain all water. Spread rice on a plate or tray for about an hour. Then grind to a semi-fine texture of that of rice rava or idli rava.
7. Later drain all the water from urad dal and add in a wet-grinder jar.
8. Add ½ teaspoon chopped ginger and 1 green chilli (chopped). 

## Making Batter

1. Add ½ cup water in parts and grind to a smooth fluffy batter. I added ½ cup water for grinding urad dal but depending on the quality of urad dal, you will need less or more water. 
2. Take the entire urad dal batter in a large bowl or pan. Keep aside. 
3. Take some portion of the rice rava mixture in your palms. Press tightly and squeeze all the water from the idli rava. Let the water get squeezed in the same bowl. Do make sure that you squeeze the rice rava or idli rava very well.
4. Add this squeezed portion of idli rava in the urad dal batter. Repeat the above step and this way add the entire squeezed idli rava to the urad dal batter.
5. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and ½ teaspoon salt or add as required. 
6. Mix very well.
7. The batter consistency is like that of idli batter. In case the batter looks thin, then add some more rice rava which has been soaked in water and later squeezed of all the water. 

## Making Dibba Rotti

1. Take a heavy and thick bottomed kadai or frying pan. Add 2 tablespoons peanut oil in the kadai. Then spread the oil on the sides of kadai by tilting the kadai or with a spoon. Let the oil become hot, but not sizzling hot.
2. Do use a heavy iron kadai or a heavy pan with a solid base or else the dibba rotti can get burnt. Peanut oil gives a good taste but you can use any other neutral flavored oil. 
3. Once the oil becomes hot, reduce the flame to its lowest. Add 3 large ladles of the dibba rotti batter.
4. Gently spread and even out the batter from the top with the back of a spoon.
5. Cover the layer of dibba rotti. Cook on a low flame.
6. Cook till the base of the dibba rotti is crisp and golden. You can make this out by checking the edges from top. The edges will have a golden color. 
7. Then turn over the half-cooked dibba rotti gently with a spatula. In case the base has not become golden & crispy, then continue to cover and cook till it becomes golden.
8. Now cook the second side. Drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons peanut oil on the sides. While cooking the second side, do not cover and cook.
9. Cook till the second side is cooked properly and you see some golden spots. To check you can insert a toothpick or a fork or knife and they should not have any sticky or uncooked batter on them. 
10. Similar way make dibba rotti from the remaining batter. Every time you make dibba rotti, add 1 to 2 tablespoons oil. If you see oil in the kadai or pan, then add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons oil. 
11. Remove from the pan. Place on a chopping board. Slice in wedges or squares and serve with onion chutney or ginger chutney or coconut chutney.
